# Telco Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting whether a telecom customer is likely to leave the service (churn) using machine learning techniques.

I worked on this project to understand how real-world tabular data is cleaned, processed, and used to build predictive models.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

- Predict customer churn (Yes or No)
- Identify factors that influence customers to leave
- Compare different machine learning models

Customer churn prediction is a common business problem in telecom and subscription-based industries.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

- Customer demographic details
- Services subscribed by customers
- Billing and payment information
- Churn status

Target variable: Churn

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow

1. Load the dataset  
2. Perform data cleaning and handle missing values  
3. Convert categorical data into numerical format  
4. Perform exploratory data analysis  
5. Split the data into training and testing sets  
6. Train a baseline model (Logistic Regression)  
7. Train an improved model (Random Forest)  
8. Evaluate and compare model performance

## Model Performance

Logistic Regression achieved approximately 78 percent accuracy.

Random Forest achieved approximately 84 percent accuracy and performed better overall.
